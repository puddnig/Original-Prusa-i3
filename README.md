# Modified Prusa i3 MK3


Original Prusa i3 MK3 OpenScad files are hard to modify, because dimensions are hardcoded and often used redundantly. I am going to rewrite all parts parametrized with parameters stored in a single file.

List of rewritten parts:

* x-end-idler
* x-end-motor
* y-belt-holder

Added parts:

* x-tensioner
