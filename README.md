# Modified Prusa i3 MK3


Original Prusa i3 MK3 OpenScad files are hard to modify, because dimensions are hardcoded and often used redundantly. I am going to rewrite all parts parametricized with parameters stored in a single file.

List of rewritten parts:

*x-end-idler
*x-end-motor

Added parts:

-x-tensioner
